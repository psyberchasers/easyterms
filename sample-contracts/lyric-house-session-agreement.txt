This is an agreement between Lyric House LLC (and its respective divisions) ("Publisher") and
songwriter _____________________ ("Writer"). For good and valuable consideration, the parties agree
as follows:

1. Publisher through its music business activities, industry contacts and channels has the ability to pair up
songwriters ("Session") to collaborate on the creation of new compositions ("Works"). Publisher intends
to use best efforts to pitch the resulting Works for synch licensing or other forms of commercial
exploitation.

2. If Writer accepts the opportunity to participate in a Session (or future Sessions) set up by Publisher,
then the following shall apply to his/her contribution share/rights in the resulting Works (words and/or
music) and, if applicable, the related sound recordings of the Works recorded at the Session, whether
demos or master quality mixes ("Masters"):

a. Writer hereby sells, assigns and transfers to Publisher for a consecutive period of five (5) years
("Term") 100% ownership interest/administration of the "publishing" rights in the Works (but Writer
shall retain his/her "writer share" rights and authorship of the Works). The rights granted to Publisher
include, but are not limited to, the sole right to exploit the Works in any and all media worldwide without
restriction, negotiate all licenses, collect all related income (except PRO songwriter share of
performance), and obtain copyrights and PRO registrations thereon in the name of Publisher. The Term
shall automatically extend for consecutive one (1) year period(s) unless earlier terminated by either party
upon at least ninety (90) days written notice before the end of the period then in effect. Upon termination,
for the avoidance of doubt, no expiration or termination of this Agreement shall restrict Publisher's right
to see through and license the placement(s) that arise post term from any and all previous pitch efforts
done by Publisher that occurred during the term. These type of pitch efforts include but are not limited to:
pitches that were sent to clients creative briefs, shared with clients in meetings and showcases about the
songs / artist, and pitches that were sent to clients for the purpose of usage in any of their projects. This
also includes songs that were written to Publisher's client briefs and projects. Overall, If the Publisher is
responsible for pitching the Composition(s) or Masters in any way, shape or form to any of their clients,
then Publisher has the right to see the placement through. Publisher has the right to execute the license,
collect fees and receive revenue on behalf of the Composition or Master from the placements that came
from their previous efforts for a period of 2 years post-Term. Moreover, Publisher has the right to see
through any placements from license requests / contracts entered into prior to termination or substantially
negotiated during the Term. (Additionally, if the contract relates to an advertisement procured by
Publisher hereunder, the post-Term collection period shall continue for the life of such advertisement
campaign which uses such Work, including any renewals and extensions).

b. Publisher shall also become the sole administrator of the related Masters for the same period and
exploitation/collection rights as set forth in #2a (but the creators shall retain copyright ownership of their
respective share of the Masters).

c. Writer shall promptly deliver to the Publisher the Works and Masters (and all related materials) created
at a Session in standard formats.

d. All the collaborators on the Session shall sign a standard "split sheet" and deliver to Publisher a fully
executed copy.

3. Publisher shall have the right to use the name, likeness and bio of the Writer in promoting and licensing
the Works/Masters.

pay to the Writer in respect of exploitation of the Works and Masters, the following:

a. A pro-rata share of 50% of all net sums actually received by the Publisher in respect of any and all
