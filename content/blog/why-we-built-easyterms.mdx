## The Problem We Saw

Every day, talented artists sign contracts they don't fully understand. Not because they're careless, but because music contracts are deliberately complex. They're filled with legal jargon, buried clauses, and terms that can lock you into unfavorable deals for years—sometimes decades.

We've seen artists sign away their masters without realizing it. We've watched musicians get trapped in 360 deals that take a cut of everything they earn. We've heard stories of publishing rights signed away "in perpetuity" before the artist even understood what that meant.

**This isn't right.**

## Why Lawyers Aren't Always the Answer

Yes, you should have a lawyer review any contract before signing. But here's the reality:

- Entertainment lawyers cost $300-500+ per hour
- Many emerging artists can't afford proper legal review
- Even with a lawyer, artists often don't understand what they're signing
- The power imbalance between labels and artists persists

We're not replacing lawyers. We're giving artists the knowledge to have informed conversations with them.

## What EasyTerms Does

EasyTerms uses AI to analyze music contracts and explain them in plain English. Upload a contract, and within seconds you'll see:

- **Risk Assessment** — What clauses could hurt you
- **Key Terms Explained** — Royalty rates, ownership, duration in simple language
- **Financial Breakdown** — What you'll actually earn under this deal
- **Negotiation Points** — What to push back on

Think of it as having a knowledgeable friend in the industry who can look at your contract and say, "Hey, this part here? That's not good for you. Here's why."
